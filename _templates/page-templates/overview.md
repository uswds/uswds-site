## Built for flexibility

These templates are just a starting point on which you can base your design. Every site built with USWDS is different, so you can add or remove components within these templates to suit your users' needs.

## Putting it all together

In each of these templates, you will find a mix of components — some modified — and utilities put to use in a way that demonstrates how USWDS can be implemented in a real-world, mobile-friendly application.
