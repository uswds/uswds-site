  # Screen reader tests
  - summary: Heading levels are logical.
    summary_additional: All header tags contain appropriate heading text that describes the content nested below it. Headings are nested appropriately. For example, there is only one `h1` per page, and no heading levels get skipped (e.g., no `h4`s nested directly under `h2`s without an `h3` between them).
