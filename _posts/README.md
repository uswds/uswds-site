# Posts
Posts and [short posts](../_posts_short/README.md) are the two content types that generate the [What's new](../README.md#adding-content-to-the-whats-new-feed) feed.

Posts are long format news posts generated by [Jekyll posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). These files will automatically generate:
- A preview for the news feed
- A separate page for the post content

This document provides instructions for [creating a new post](#creating-a-new-post), [customizing a post's metadata](#customizing-post-metadata), and following [post conventions](#post-conventions).

## Creating a new post

1. To create a new post, create a new branch then add a new file to the `/_posts` directory with a filename in the form:
   
    ```
    YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    ```
    where:
    - `YYYY` is the 4-digit year (`2025`) of the publish date
    - `MM` is the 2-digit month, with a leading zero (`01` for January, `02` for February, etc.)
    - `DD` is the 2-digit day of the month, also with a leading zero
    - `title` is the so-called "slug" used in the post URL, and should be all lowercase replace spaces with dashes (e.g. `my-post-title`)

    
    The YYYY-MM-DD date set in the file name will:
      - Display as the "date" in the post
      - Sort the post in reverse chronological order (newest items first) in the news feed.

    See the [Jekyll documentation about creating posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files) for more info.

2. Next, in the file's contents, copy and paste the following blank template:
    ```
    ---
    title:
    category: About
    author:
    tags:
    ---
    
    An introductory plain text paragraph.
    
    ## This is an h2 heading
    
    An ordered list with three items:
    1. Item one
    1. Item two
    1. Item three
    ```
    The content inside the triple-dashed lines (`---`) is the post's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). You will need to customize the the front matter to define the post's title, author, and more. See the table and code example in the [customizing post metadata](#customizing-post-metadata) section to see the available customization options. 
   
   Everything below the triple-dashed lines is the content that will appear in the generated post page. Whenever possible, write post content in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). However, HTML is also supported. See the [post conventions](#post-conventions) section below for additional guidance.

## Customizing post metadata

The following table provides reference for the available front matter customization options:

| Key | Description | Required |
|--------|--------|--------|
| title | The title of the post | Yes |
| category | The site category that ties the post to the side navigation. The value for this should always be "About". | Yes|
| author | The author(s) listed in the byline | No |
| tags | The tag that describes the category of the post. Multiple tags can be added. | No |
| excerpt | The post summary that will be included in the post preview | Yes |
| lead | The first paragraph of your post displayed in large ("lead") text. When present, the lead will be used as the "excerpt" in the post preview. | No |
| expiration_date | The date when this post will receive the "This content is outdated" alert. This is typically set 2 years from the publication date. | No |

Here is a sample front matter customization:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor
category: About
author: Suzy Q, Jane Doe, and Joe Schmoe
tags:
  - discussion
  - news
excerpt: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus egestas sed felis eget sodales.
---
```

## Post conventions

In general, the following conventions should be followed in your posts:

1. Prefer Markdown files (`.md`) to HTML (`.html`), and remember: You can always embed HTML in Markdown, but not the other way around.

1. When linking to other pages on the site, **always** prefix URIs with the Jekyll base URL (`{{ site.baseurl }}`):

    ```md
    ## Good
    Check out [what's new]({{ site.baseurl }}/whats-new/)!

    ## Bad
    Check out [what's new](/whats-new/)!
