# Security

## Our security policies and procedures

We follow GSA's [IT security policy](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/information-integrity-and-access/gsa-it-security-policies) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of USWDS.

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to find, fix, and prevent vulnerabilities in USWDS dependencies. We run Snyk checks locally during development and automatically on all pull requests.

We perform static analysis on our JavaScript on every pull requests with [GitHub CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql).
