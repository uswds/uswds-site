- **Allow multiple file formats.** Not everyone has access to the same software. Be flexible with file types to avoid unnecessary software requirements.
- **Prefer one file per input.** Some users might not know how to select multiple files in a file browser. Additionally, iOS does not allow multiple-file selection using the Files app.
- **Use hint text to highlight input restrictions.** Use `usa-hint` to be clear about any file restrictions, such as document types or file size.
