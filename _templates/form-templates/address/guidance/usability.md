- <span class="usa-tag">Deprecated USWDS 2.10.2</span> <s><strong>Don’t call out required fields.</strong> Call out optional fields instead. Users can infer that non-optional fields are required.</s>
- **Consider using an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/input-mask">input mask</a>.** In fields with a specific expected format, an input mask allows you to constrain and shape the information being entered into that format, without impairing the user’s ability to copy/paste or correct mistyping. If you use an input mask for the ZIP code field, it should be #####-#### so that the ZIP code maps to users’ experience with ZIP codes and is properly formatted, regardless of whether a user enters a five- or nine-digit ZIP code. Input masks can help a user more confidently fill out restricted fields, reduce user anxiety about making a mistake, and reduce validation errors and web form abandonment, particularly on mobile devices.
- **Support both five- and nine-digit ZIP codes.** Some addresses require a nine-digit ZIP code. If you would like to use an input mask, it should be “#####-####” so that the text is properly formatted, regardless of whether a user enters a five- or nine-digit ZIP code.
