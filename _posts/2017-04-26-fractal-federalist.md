<p class="usa-font-lead">
  We've recently added two powerful tools to our development workflow that
  allow us to preview, test, and publish the Standards code more quickly
  and easily.
</p>

## Fractal

[Fractal] is a powerful and flexible framework for building interactive
component libraries. It's similar to [Jekyll][] (which we use to publish this
site) in one key respect: It operates primarily on simple file naming
conventions. Organize your files in a specific way, using the content and data
formats it understands, and it will generate a web site automatically.

**Check out the Standards in Fractal:**

[![View the Standards in Fractal]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/updates/fractal_v1.0.0.png)]({{ page.preview_baseurl }}/develop/)

### Why Fractal?

* **It's [open source]**, so we didn't have to pay for it (which can be
  time-consuming and difficult to authorize in government), and we can easily
  modify it to suit our needs.

* **It's easy to use.** Fractal supports some of the same, user-friendly file
  formats as Jekyll, such as [Markdown] and [YAML]; and it comes with a handy
  development server that reloads the site automatically whenever you change a
  file.

* It generates **standalone HTML previews of each component**, which we can use
  for [accessibility][accessibility testing], [cross-browser], [performance]({{
  site.baseurl }}/performance/), and [visual regression] testing.

* **It uses or supports many of the technologies we use already** (or intend to
  use in the future), such as [Node.js][] (the JavaScript environment in which
  we write, build, and publish our code) and [Nunjucks] templates --- which are
  compatible with a number of other template languages, including [Jinja2] for
  Python and [Twig], the PHP templating engine [used by Drupal][Drupal twig].

* Fractal offers a **[customizable theme engine]**, so we can make it look and
  feel like the Standards.

### Thinking in components

Fractal's component-oriented architecture nudged us to consider how each of
[our own components]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/) really _work_: What are
their moving parts, and how do their "variants" (for instance, our [basic]({{
site.baseurl }}/components/headers/#basic) and [extended]({{ site.baseurl
}}/components/headers/#extended) headers) differ from one another? The process
of adapting our components to Fractal produced a basic [interface inventory],
which shows us exactly where we are right now, and the interactive previews
give us the confidence to make bigger changes because we can immediately see
their impacts on various aspects of the Standards.

### Painless development

Fractal has also made it much simpler to work on the Standards' CSS,
JavaScript, and HTML component templates. Previously, the only "place" we could
test our components interactively was on this site, which was tricky to set up:
Each person needed to clone both of our repositories, `npm link` them together,
then manually restart the Jekyll server so that it would detect changes to the
code. Contrast that with the four commands necessary to get up and running now
(assuming you have [Node.js] version 6 or greater installed):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards.git
cd web-design-standards
npm install
npm start
```

Now each of us has a powerful development, testing, and documentation tool at
our fingertips, which we can use to test every aspect of the Standards code
without any of the customizations we've made on this site. Fractal even comes
with a handy resizable preview window we can use to test the responsiveness of
each component or page template without having to resize our entire browser
window.

**But wait, there's more!** Fractal is an invaluable tool for those of us
developing the Standards on our own computers, but what if we put it... _on the
cloud?_ That's where Federalist comes in.


## Federalist

In a nutshell, [Federalist] is an open source [GitHub Pages] for government: a platform that
automatically builds and publishes static sites whenever we push commits to our
[GitHub repository]. Unlike GitHub Pages, though, Federalist isn't limited to
publishing just static files and [Jekyll] sites: We can use the same [Node.js]
tools we use to develop the Standards to publish our Fractal component library
as a static site on Federalist.

One of Federalist's most useful features is its ability to publish "branch
previews". Whenever we push commits to a branch on GitHub, Federalist
builds a new version of the site and publishes it at a predictable URL. For
instance, you can see the current state of our [`develop` branch
preview]({{ page.preview_baseurl }}/develop/), or you can kick the tires of
our [forthcoming version 1.1.0 release][1.1.0 pre-release] on the
[`release-1.1.0-pre` branch]({{ page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0-pre/).

Federalist hosts other websites across government and is open for business. If you're interested in using it to host and preview your own federal static sites, please [get in touch with that team!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iB8aW7c9r1QH3s8XElQCrnXRGjAiPUYpWG1CMeEqGIo/viewform)

Equipped with Fractal and Federalist's automatically published URLs, we can add
preview links to each of our GitHub pull requests, and more quickly collect
feedback on proposed changes. Whenever we create a new pull request, we can
paste the following template at the top and replace `{BRANCH}` with the pull
request branch name:

```md
### [:eyes: Preview on Federalist]({{ page.preview_baseurl }}/{BRANCH}/)
```

The resulting [pull request][example PR] description looks like this:

[![A GitHub pull request with Fractal preview link]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/updates/federalist-preview-link.png)][example PR]

We can even link directly to [individual]({{ page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0/components/detail/header--basic.html) [components]({{
page.preview_baseurl }}/release-1.1.0/components/detail/header--extended.html),
and their [standalone]({{ page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0/components/preview/header--basic.html) [previews]({{
page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0/components/preview/header--extended.html). These links help us
provide more targeted feedback and more quickly address any issues that arise.

### Versioned assets and documentation

Another technique we're exploring is making versioned assets (the Standards
CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts) more readily accessible for testing on
other sites. In fact we're already doing this with Federalist, which
includes the git branch in its preview URLs. This means you can link directly
to the [JavaScript]({{ page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0-pre/dist/js/uswds.min.js) or [CSS]({{ page.preview_baseurl
}}/release-1.1.0-pre/dist/css/uswds.min.css) from our [version 1.1.0
pre-release][1.1.0 pre-release] once you know the URL format:

```
{{ page.preview_baseurl }}/release-{VERSION}/dist/{FILENAME}
```

These URLs will only work for version 1.1.0 and above. You can get the assets
from previous releases with [unpkg] using URLs in this format:

```
https://unpkg.com/uswds@{VERSION}/dist/{FILENAME}
```

Having these public, predictable URLs make it easier for us to create test
cases with "live-coding" tools such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) and
[CodePen](https://codepen.io). We used JSFiddle to create a [live test
case](https://jsfiddle.net/47Lpu62z/9/) for [this accordion
bug](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/1762) that references
the JavaScript from a branch to demonstrate the proposed fix. In this case, the
reporter of the issue was able to download that same script and confirm the fix
on their project!

## What's next

We're working on a reorganization of this site that will incorporate Fractal's
standalone component previews and code samples so we don't have to maintain
them in two different places. We're also exploring the possibility of enabling
live editing capabilities in Fractal so that we can more quickly create and
share test cases for each of our components. We've also got more work to do on
fully porting our old component templates over to Fractal and better organizing
our components, variants, page templates, and related documentation.
