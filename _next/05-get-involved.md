### Everyone can:

- Use the conversation starters throughout this report to prompt discussions with your managers and team members

- Join the [USWDS community](https://chat.18f.gov/) and get involved

### Thought-leaders can:

- Be vocal advocates of USWDS and the benefits it provides

- [Share critical, candid feedback with us](mailto:{{ site.uswds_email }}) to help make the design system better

### Policy analysts can:

- Better define what [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) compliance is

- Think about how shared digital services can be better used throughout government and how policy could support that effort

- Identify key performance indicators and include digital services in strategic plans

### Content managers can:

- Use the [design system’s [principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-principles/) to bring human-centered design into your work and make data-informed decisions

- Review the design system’s [UX guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/maturity-model/#level-2-follow-user-experience-guidance) around content and its organization

- Become familiar with the [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/) and proactively think about how you can use them to highlight and present content on your site

- Reach out to your [Federal Web Council](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/) representative to learn more about your agency’s digital strategy and modernization plans

### Engineers can:

- Review [design system documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/developers/) to learn about the design system’s architecture and available components

- Learn about [customization, theming,]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/settings/) [utilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/), and [tokens]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-tokens/) to adapt the design system to your agency’s brand

- Review existing websites that use USWDS (such as those in the [Showcase]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/showcase/)) to see how you could better integrate USWDS [principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-principles/) and [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/)

### Designers can:

- [Download the design assets]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/designers/) and work to incorporate them into your regular design process

- Investigate how the design system can be customized to meet your agency’s brand needs

- Review existing websites that use USWDS (such as the [design system Showcase]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/showcase/)) to see how you could better integrate the design system [principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-principles/) and [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/)

### Leadership can:

- Talk with other agency leadership to learn how they’ve implemented the design system

- [Develop a plan for how your agency could adopt it]({{ site.baseurl }}/maturity-model/), including aligning with modernization plan priorities, developing timelines, and budgeting

- Make sure websites have ongoing funding and resource support

- Connect CIOs, web/digital managers, evaluation officers, chief data officers, and other federal program leaders to align on how [customer experience](https://www.performance.gov/cx/) priorities are being integrated across all areas of work

To improve USWDS as a product, we’ll begin refining and implementing the next steps outlined in this report, incorporating additional research and input from the USWDS community as we go. Agencies interested in participating in this process — or simply in learning more about the design system — can join us in our [public Slack channel (#uswds-public)]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/community/), for [our monthly calls](https://digital.gov/events/), and in the [digital.gov communities of practice](https://digital.gov/communities/).

We also look forward to collaborating with our digital services colleagues in [TTS](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and beyond to explore new ways of providing shared value for government and articulate a more defined path toward our [North Star vision]( {{ site.baseurl }}/next/looking-ahead/vision/) of empowered digital teams and trusted experiences.

We thank everyone who shared their time, feedback, and ideas throughout this research effort and invite you — our collaborators and colleagues — to join us in further exploring these big-picture questions by joining our community and attending our events.
