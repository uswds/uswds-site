- **Don’t alter icons.** You shouldn’t customize, combine, or change USWDS icons (other than updating the color) due to their [license](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/LICENSE.md).
- **Active icons are found in `dist/img/usa-icons`.** The icons in this directory will be packaged into an SVG sprite. The complete set of available icons are located in two directories: `dist/img/material-icons` and `dist/img/uswds-icons`. Copy icons into a `usa-icons` directory within your project images directory, and rebuild the SVG sprite using [uswds-compile](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-compile/).
- **Using color in icons.** Icons use `currentColor`, so the color of the icon will be the text color of its parent element. Change colors with the [color utility]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/color/).
- **Relative to font size.** By default, icons will scale with font size. If you want to specify an icon size, use one of the component’s size variants.
- **Icon names are identifiers.**  To use an icon, simply change the identifier after the pound sign in the sprite path to that icon’s name. For example, to use the `accessibility_new` icon, the path will be `<use xlink:href="/path/to/sprite.svg#accessibility_new">`, or to use the info icon, the path will be `<use xlink:href="/path/to/sprite.svg#info">`.
