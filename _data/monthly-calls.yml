  - title: The next generation of the design system
    subtitle: The new, modular USWDS we'll deliver in 2025
    description: |
      At the November monthly call, we laid out our vision for the direction of the design system. USWDS Product Lead Dan Williams shared exciting news about the beta for our new [USWDS Figma design kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1440921849343185329/uswds-design-kit-beta). USWDS Experience Design Lead Anne Petersen and USWDS Engineering Lead Matt Henry joined Dan to explain the design system’s shift toward modularity, and the relationship between the existing codebase (which we'll rename USWDS Core) and the Web Components–based version (which we're calling USWDS Elements), as well as with design tokens, utilities, and new design kit.

    description: |
      The October monthly call centered on U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) product and engineering values. To frame the discussion, USWDS Experience Design Lead Anne Petersen examined how the design system’s product and design principles have evolved over the nine year history of USWDS. USWDS Product Lead Dan Williams and USWDS Engineering Lead Matt Henry then presented a set of new product and engineering values and discussed how they will guide decision-making about USWDS Web Components and the broader development of the design system.

  - title: The landscape of Web Components
    subtitle: What we've learned from other design systems
    description: |
      At the September 2024 monthly call, UX Researcher (USWDS contractor) Jacline Contrino shared results of the team’s recent landscape analysis of Web Components–based design systems. The research focused on four core areas of current design systems and areas for development: documentation, code structure, code size and performance, and distribution.

      USWDS Product Lead Dan Williams and USWDS Engineering Lead Matt Henry expanded on the research to discuss how USWDS currently fits into that landscape and how the design system is positioned for future innovations. The research findings will be foundational to developing engineering principles that will guide the team’s future decision-making about USWDS Web Components and the design system overall.

      the [accordion](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/accessibility-tests/),
      [button](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button/accessibility-tests/), and
      [link](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/link/accessibility-tests/)
      components. We also discussed the months of work that led to their
      launch. The process started with internal manual accessibility testing of USWDS components. We
      then prototyped the pages that explain how we tested and what we found in those tests. Later,
      usability testing with participants from the USWDS community shaped the iterative development of
      these pages. We look forward to updating the community as we roll out accessibility tests for more
      USWDS components.
