- **Use proper labels and attributes.** Each file input should have a `<label>`. Associate the two by matching the `<label>`’s `for` attribute to the `<input>`’s `id` attribute.
- **Use as a progressive enhancement.** The file input component should be a progressive enhancement of `<input type="file" />`. If the component doesn't initialize, it should still work and appear like a standard `file` input.
