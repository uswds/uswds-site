USWDS uses Snyk to check for vulnerabilities in our dependencies. We run this
check locally during development and automatically on pull requests. This ensures
that new vulnerabilities are not introduced and our package is up-to-date.

You can verify that USWDS is secure by checking the vulnerability badge in the
[code repository](https://github.com/uswds/uswds)

To ensure you’re using a legitimate copy of USWDS, we strongly encourage you to
download the package via [NPM](/documentation/developers/#install-using-npm).
Using the NPM package rather than the `.zip` also makes it easier to stay
up-to-date on the latest USWDS versions.
