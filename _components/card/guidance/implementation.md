- **Control card size and layout with USWDS utilities.** The card component works well with [layout grid utilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/layout-grid/). The `usa-card-group` block is functionally a wrap-able `grid-row`, and each individual `usa-card` is a `grid-col`. This means you can use a grid utility like `tablet:grid-col-4` to set a four-column size on a card at `tablet` width. You can also set custom grid gaps on a `usa-card-group` using `grid-gap` utilities.

    Since the Design System grid is based on flexbox, you can use [flex positioning utilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/flex/) on the card group. The default alignment is stretch (stretch aligns the top and bottom of each card in a row), but the `flex-align-start` utility can set the alignment to the top of the row.
- **Control image aspect ratio with the `add-aspect` utility.** Add [aspect ratio utility classes]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/height-and-width/#aspect) to `usa-card__img` or `usa-card__media` elements to control the aspect ratio on card images. Alternatively, control aspect ratio in your Sass files via the [`add-aspect` mixin]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/height-and-width/#utility-mixins).
- **Style cards with utilities.** Style the `usa-card__container` element with utilities to achieve custom effects, such as changing the border or background color or adding a drop shadow.
