- **There should be enough color contrast between the text of the link and the background to ensure readability.**
- **Provide a visual element that shows when the text is a link.** For example, permanently underline text or when hovering.
- **The language of each page should be identified using the HTML lang attribute (`<html lang="en">`, for example).** Please see [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html).
- **All logically related items/links must be presented as an HTML unordered list.** Please see [H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H48.html).
- **Language links should contain a span element with the lang attribute.** Every language link in the language selector dropdown, that is different from content of the current page, should be defined using the lang attribute on a `<span>` tag wrapping the relevant text (e.g., `<span lang="es">Hola</span> means Hello.`). Please see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html).
