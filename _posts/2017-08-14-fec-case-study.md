The U.S. Web Design Standards are currently being used on hundreds of government
sites, with an audience of more than 59 million monthly users. In this eighth
post in our series, we met with Jennifer Thibault, visual designer and
innovation specialist, to talk about the Federal Election Commission (FEC)’s use
of the Standards on [fec.gov][].

**Standards team:** How did you find out about the U.S. Web Design Standards?

**Jennifer Thibault:** We knew of the USWDS project early on since it was
kicked off by a team inside 18F. But, we needed to get out a
[basic set of pages and content models][612] on fec.gov before the Standards
team released their first version.

In 2015, we started with a visual identity audit to show our team what the
audience was seeing: “Here’s the 12 different ways you’re using your logo and
the 25 different fonts and all the colors you probably didn’t know were being
used on your site. Here’s the system you had—whether you knew it or not—and
let’s make some sense out of it.”

We sent all this research to the Standards team, who at that point, was auditing
federal sites to gather all the designs and styles happening across government,
and the FEC became an early research participant.

When the first version of the Standards was released, we updated our patterns
with components that were similar to what we already had, but kept them styled
with the FEC’s new visual look and feel.

**Standards team:** Which components did you use?

**Thibault:** The footer was one of the first things we used. Every agency has
to customize a little bit, but we followed the information pattern and layout.
We appreciated that it was a flexible template with a few different options.

We also used the visual styling of the small search bar, the label and some of
the basic layouts around the navigation, and switched to the Standards’ side
navigation component once it was released.

More recently, I’ve come to the Standards site for the hero layout, which is a
really good way to show an image with text over it. Accessibility is baked right
in to the visual approach—it’s a smart way of having image and text and
separating them to have high-enough contrast to make it accessible. Many times
folks put text over an image and think it’s great until they realize it’s not
legible or accessible for people who can’t see color.

I come back to the Standards, because they have easy-to-use, ready-made
solutions for many design scenarios the FEC has. No need to reinvent the wheel
if this looks good and works.

**Standards team:** Is there anything the Standards team could do to help
you in your efforts?

**Thibault:** The FEC site has really detailed financial tables and we would
love to see recommendations for data-heavy sites. It would also help to have
best practices for how to handle long-form content. The FEC, like other
agencies, has a lot of compliance guidance, which can result in very long
pages of content—no matter how far down you distill it.

**Standards team:** Advice for other agencies?

**Thibault:** It’s really helped us to think about the U.S. Web Design
Standards as a resource where we can take what’s useful and leave what we don’t
need. You have a choice. Take the stuff that makes your life easier, use your
agency’s styles, and leave the rest.

If you decide to add more of the components later, you’re already familiar with
the resources and the team behind the Standards, because you’ve already been
asking questions.
