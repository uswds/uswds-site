- **Combine icons with text.** Only a few icons are consistently understood across the digital-using public of the world, among them home ({{ home_icon }}), print ({{ print_icon }}), and search ({{ search_icon }}). Combine icons with text to improve clarity, and test your icons for recognition and memorability with your particular audience.
- **Be consistent with icon meaning.** Icons used more than once in an application or site must be used to represent the same thing, and have the same text description in every instance. For example, if an icon of a blank piece of paper means “new document” on most screens, choose a different icon to communicate “reformat document.” Consistency helps people with some cognitive disabilities, helps people who might be distracted or scanning, and creates a better user experience for all.
- **Combine interactive icons with other components.** If the icon is part of an interactive element, it should be implemented within another functional component. For example, make an icon part of a button or list.
