- **Don't roadblock external links with a modal window or dialog box.** Allow users to follow external links without taking a separate action to acknowledge leaving your site. Roadblock notices result in a poor user experience and are redundant with both the link's destination context (see [Provide plain text context for external links](#what-you-should-do), above) any external link indicator (see [If you use an external link indicator, use it consistently](#what-you-must-do), above), and your site's policy and notices page (see [Provide required notification for non-federal external links](#what-you-must-do), above).

- **Don’t use generic link text.** Vague text like “click here” and “read more” is confusing and repetitive, especially to screen readers. Link text should describe the destination and explain where users will go if they follow the link.

- **Don’t use the same link text for different URLs on the same page.** Differentiate between links by using unique text for each.

- **Don’t use external link icons.** There is no universally understood external link icon. External link icons are often interpreted as “share”, "launch", or “open in a new tab.” Avoid using icons unless it is your agency’s preferred style.
