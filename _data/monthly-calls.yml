  - title: USWDS component lifecycle
    subtitle: How ideas for new components become proposals and how you can help
    description: |
      We reviewed how community [suggestions](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/categories/component-proposals) become formal proposals for new components. USWDS counts on community feedback and we [encourage you to contribute](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/contribute/). We also talked about the lifecycle for existing components.

  - title: Component-based accessibility tests
    subtitle: Manual accessibility tests for the whole team
    description: |
      We shared new component-based accessibility test pages (formerly called “critical checklists”) for
      the [accordion](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/accessibility-tests/),
      [button](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button/accessibility-tests/), and
      [link](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/link/accessibility-tests/)
      components. We also discussed the months of work that led to their
      launch. The process started with internal manual accessibility testing of USWDS components. We
      then prototyped the pages that explain how we tested and what we found in those tests. Later,
      usability testing with participants from the USWDS community shaped the iterative development of
      these pages. We look forward to updating the community as we roll out accessibility tests for more
      USWDS components.

  - title: Designing a repeatable research process with people with disabilities
    subtitle: Managing and sustaining our user research
    description: |
      We continued a discussion from the October monthly call about ongoing research on how
      the design system works for users with disabilities. We presented more
      [research findings](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Usability-research-findings-for-Q3-2023)
      and talked about what those results mean for USWDS components. We also defined
      [best research practices](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Usability-testing-day-checklist)
      and plans to continue, improve, and share findings from this work.

  - title: Conducting user research on how USWDS serves people with disabilities
    subtitle: How to develop a sustainable, repeatable research process
    description: |
      One of our roadmap goals is to conduct more user research with people who have disabilities —
      and to ensure we're doing so regularly.
      We shared our progress and reported on findings from our first round of this research:
      working with users who have visual impairments to conduct usability tests on design system components.
