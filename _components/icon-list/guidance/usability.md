- **Use consistent headings.** Headings should be written with parallel structure.  For example, start each with an action verb. When possible, keep headings short enough to fit on one or two lines.
- **Add rich content sparingly.** Each list item can display rich text content like HTML, images, and even other components. Be succinct. Too much complexity distracts from the impact of an icon list.
- **Use similar icons.** Use the same icon for each list item unless variation is meaningful, as with our `check_circle` icon (<svg class="usa-icon bottom-neg-2px" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"><use href="/assets/img/sprite.svg#check_circle"></use></svg>) and `cancel` icon (<svg class="usa-icon bottom-neg-2px" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"><use href="/assets/img/sprite.svg#cancel"></use></svg>).  Icons should come from the same icon library and have a similar look and feel.
