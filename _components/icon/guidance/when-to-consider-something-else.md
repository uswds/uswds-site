- **Meaning is ambiguous.** Use icons only in a common or conventional way. Icon utility hinges on people quickly recognizing what each icon means. If you suspect that an icon’s intent isn’t perfectly clear, consider removing it or adding accompanying text.
- **Compensating for page structure.** Don’t rely on an icon to help draw attention to something important that’s otherwise hard to find. Icons don’t fix unclear page hierarchy or confusing content organization.
- **You need illustrative artwork.** Icons have a specific, functional meaning. Avoid using icons for illustrative purposes. For example, don't use the "visibility" eye icon ({{ visibility_icon }}) to illustrate an actual eye. If you want to enhance the appearance of your content or visually explain a concept, use an illustration instead of an icon.
