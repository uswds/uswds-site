- **Code header areas in the accordion as buttons.** Using a `<button type="button">` assures accordions are usable with both screen readers and keyboards.
- **Use meaningful expansion button labels.** Aim for informative labels like “Explore federal compliance checklists” rather than vague ones like “Click here.”
- **Use `aria-controls` to associate an accordion button with its related content.** Connect an accordion button control with its appropriate content region by referencing the controlled element’s `id` in the button's `aria-controls` attribute.
- **Use unique ids.** Each button has a unique name, `aria-controls="[id]"`, that associates the control with the appropriate region by referencing the controlled element’s `id`.
- **Accordions use javascript to set the `hidden` values of their content areas.** Each content area will have its `hidden` attribute set by the component, depending on its corresponding button’s `aria-expanded` attribute. To ensure your content is accessible in the event that the JavaScript does not load or is disabled, you should not manually set `hidden` on any of your content areas.
- **You do not need to add text alternatives for the collapsed and expanded accordion states.** These states are set programmatically with JavaScript.
